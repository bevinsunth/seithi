# Seithi Brain

Python-based ML worker for news classification and analysis.

## Purpose

- ML-based article classification (ragebait vs. nuanced)
- Hybrid categorization using RSS tags, URL heuristics, and ML
- Background processing of news articles
- Model training and evaluation

## Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python
- **ML Framework**: Sentence Transformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)
- **Task Queue**: TBD (e.g., Celery, RQ)
- **Message Broker**: TBD (e.g., Redis, RabbitMQ)

## POC Backup

The initial proof-of-concept implementation is preserved in the `poc-backup/` directory for reference.
